## visualizing geographic multilayer weighted social network model

This application visualizes a time evolution of social network formation using a geographic multilayer weighted social network model.
The model was proposed in [Y. Murase et al., "Multilayer Weighted Social Network Model", Phys.Rev.E (2014)](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.90.052810).
The paper is available also on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1190).

## How to run

- You need [processing](http://processing.org/).
